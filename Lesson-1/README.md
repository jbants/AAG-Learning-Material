In this lesson we will be creating a basic webmap using the leaflet javascript library and basic HTML.
We will learn how to load data from different providers and will create vector geometry for displaying in the map.

The intent of this lesson is to provide you with a basic handle on how to create a webmap and to understand the functions of the different components that make up a webmap.
